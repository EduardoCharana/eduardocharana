Hi I'm Ed

I’m an aspiring QA (Quality Assurance) professional, currently learning essential tools and technologies for test automation and software quality control.



Tools I’m learning:

Postman: for API testing and automation.
Cypress: for front-end test automation and validating workflows in the browser.

My goal is to master these tools to ensure software is functional, reliable, and of high quality. I’m excited to dive deeper into the world of testing and automation!
